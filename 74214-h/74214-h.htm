<p class="drop-img unindent">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_o.jpg" alt="O" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">f</span> course, the people which participated in
things of this sort are dead now, and so
is nearly every one which ever knew anything
about the matter, but occasionally you will run
across an old Hawaiian whose memory you can
always refresh by showing him a bit of silver,
and then you will hear tales of the days when
smuggling opium into Honolulu was a common
practise.</p>

<p>There are some who will tell you that the
blocks on the sidewalk on the right hand side of
Alakea street were taken from the holds of
smugglers. Nothing so very astonishing, only,
in the middle of these blocks the initiated found
a can of opium. Parties would contract for a
load of Chinese stone and the unsuspecting Customs
man would pass the ship which brought it.
But when the stones were safely carried away,
this same Customs man would have been astonished,
could he have seen a man remove a layer
from a block and take out from the cavity a can.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
He would have been further astounded could he
have seen what the can contained.</p>

<p>Ah Pung had contracted for such a load of
stone and was anxiously awaiting the arrival of
the ship bearing it.</p>

<p>Smuggling opium was getting to be a risky
proposition and in view of the alarming number
of captures which the government had made
and the large amount of fines which it had collected
from those whom it captured, Ah Pung
made a mental resolve, as he walked down to the
Pilot House to ask if the <i>Fanny</i> had been
sighted, that with the sale of this load, his part
in this illegal business terminated.</p>

<p>The <i>Fanny</i> was making an unusually slow
passage, and many were the conjectures placed
upon her delay.</p>

<p>“Bet you she’s got a load of opium this trip,”
said one old sea dog to a group of his companions.</p>

<p>“Your bet is safe,” was the reply from the
youngest of the number, “she had a load of it
last trip. My opinion on her delay is this: Her
captain’s got the wind that somethin’ is blowing
wrong and he’s not going to risk his cargo
and his ship by coming in, unless the coast is
clear.</p>

<p>“Old Captain Mitchell is too crafty a sea dog
to be caught napping. He’s been engaged in
this smuggling business for over twenty years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Used to smuggle wines from Portugal into Boston
Harbor at one time, and then, when he
found the job getting pretty hot, he took his
ship when no body was looking, and went into
smuggling opium. I was first mate under him
two trips ago, and I know.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you,” he said suddenly to the first
speaker, “I’ll bet you that this old Chink has
got the cargo on board the <i>Fanny</i> this time.”</p>

<p>The group fixed its eyes on Ah Pung who
was nervously watching a customs officer who,
from time to time, was scanning the horizon
with his glass.</p>

<p>Hearing what the mate said, Ah Pung turned
to them and said, “Yes, me got calgo on boad
the <i>Flanny</i>. Too muchee building stone this
trip. Got big contlact make floo’ for lice thleshing,
up Waiau.”</p>

<p>A number of the sailors nodded as if they
accepted the Chinaman’s story, but the mate
smiled. “That’s all right, John; don’t need to
worry about us, you pig-tailed heathen. I know
very well what’s inside them stones, but if you
can land them without that chap nabbing you,
you’ll have my sincerest admiration. I tell
you,” he said lowering his voice, “you’d better
get some kind of a signal out to the <i>Fanny</i> telling
her not to land those stones at the wharf.”</p>

<p>The Chinaman looked the mate over carefully
and then, as if satisfied with his examination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
he said, “My lice schooner captain he sick. You
number one sailor; you take my boat to Waiau
now.”</p>

<p>Roberts understood the ruse and got up smilingly
from his box and went over to Ah Pung’s
rice schooner. The sails were hoisted and the
little schooner bounded out of the harbor. Instead
of turning to his right, to where Waiau
lay, Roberts steered the schooner in the direction
of Diamond Head.</p>

<p>In response to the Chinaman’s inquiring look
Roberts said, “That government schooner is out
somewhere. We’ll have to find out where before
we can do anything.”</p>

<p>The schooner was skimming along at a good
clip when Ah Pung’s excited eyes saw another
schooner bearing down upon them.</p>

<p>“No,” Roberts said after looking the new
comer over, “that’s not the <i>Fanny</i>; that’s the
customs’ schooner. Well, we’ll make for
Waiau.”</p>

<p>Carefully swinging her around, he started
back to town but was hailed with the cry, “Ship
ahoy!”</p>

<p>“The <i>Moi Wahine</i>,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Haul hard until we come up to you,” was
the order.</p>

<p>Roberts had the one sailor on board haul down
the sails and awaited the coming of the customs
boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
“What are you doing?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“Merely trying this boat.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Want to buy her.”</p>

<p>“What made you turn around when you saw
us?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t see you until after I had started to
come back.”</p>

<p>The officer seemed appeased and he ordered
his own sail up. Roberts followed suit and
turning to the captain he said, “I’ll race you
back to the harbor for a drink all around.”</p>

<p>“That’s to find out who has the faster boat,”
he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>“All right, let her go,” he shouted and both
boats fairly flew, cutting the water with clean,
sharp strokes as they sped along.</p>

<p>Roberts put on all the sail he had; the customs
man did the same and gained rapidly.</p>

<p>“Whew,” muttered Roberts, “not much of a
chance for us, Ah Pung, if we were in a pinch
now. But wait a moment, I’ll fix him.” He
veered slightly to the left and took advantage of
a sudden puff of wind. That was all the <i>Moi
Wahine</i> needed; her masts fairly groaned under
the spread of canvas and soon the customs man
was out of sight.</p>

<p>“I understand her now,” Roberts said, “I’ll
guarantee to beat anything in these waters. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
let’s go to Waiau. I want to see what kind of
a harbor they have there.”</p>

<p>“Nothing decent,” was his verdict. “Catch
us here easy. I have it,” he said finally, “there’s
Ford’s Island off there,” jerking his thumb in
the direction of the island, “that’ll help us
alright. Now let’s go back to the harbor and
get those drinks the captain owes us.”</p>

<p>The captain was found pouring a drink from
a demijohn in his office. “It’s on me,” he called
as Roberts passed by. He entered and took the
mug which the captain filled for him.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he asked, “what were you doing
out by Diamond Head this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Looking for the <i>Fanny</i>. I can’t imagine
what’s become of the boat.”</p>

<p>“What’s so wonderful on the <i>Fanny</i> that
makes you so anxious to meet her?”</p>

<p>“Opium.”</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Nothing now. Wait until she gets
into the harbor and then nab the man that her
cargo is assigned to.”</p>

<p>“But supposing he manages to land the cargo
before the boat reaches the harbor, then what?”</p>

<p>“Take a mighty smart man to skin me, old
fellow. Fill up your mug, I see it’s empty.”</p>

<p>“Here’s to the <i>Fanny</i>; may she make port
safely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>The captain looked at Roberts in mild surprise
but he drank the toast and added, “May
she make port safely and give her cargo up to
the government.”</p>

<p>Roberts left the room and found Ah Pung
waiting for him.</p>

<p>“You come my house eat,” he said.</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted and Roberts was
soon at Ah Pung’s home. It was a pretentious
dwelling, for Ah Pung had money. He had
married a Hawaiian woman who possessed a
large quantity of land. A part of this her husband
had sold to enable him to buy opium, and
after the second trip, he was counted a rich man.</p>

<p>Ah Pung had a daughter. Though dark-skinned,
Kealoha was fair to behold. She had
inherited her mother’s Hawaiian beauty, and
her only Chinese characteristic shown from her
eyes.</p>

<p>Sam Roberts was a roving sort of a fellow.
Many were the girls who would have gladly
married him “back East,” but he would have
none of them. Tonight, as he sat on the floor,
which formed Ah Pung’s dining table, by the
side of pretty Kealoha, he thought he had never
seen any Hawaiian or any other maiden look
so lovely.</p>

<p>Around her head she had a <i>lei</i> of red carnations,
and another of <i>ilima</i> hung around her
neck. Lost in the contemplation of so lovely a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
vision, Roberts failed to do justice to the excellent
meal which Ah Pung had provided.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, Ah Pung led his guest
out to the lanai and together they planned their
campaign.</p>

<p>“You help me, I help you,” said Ah Pung.</p>

<p>“Yes, I help you, but what do I get out of this
business?”</p>

<p>Ah Pung had noticed the effect which Kealoha
had produced upon Roberts and with a
crafty smile he answered, “You help me, make
me win, I give you Kealoha.”</p>

<p>“But suppose she won’t have me?”</p>

<p>“Kealoha have anybody I tell her have,” was
the Chinaman’s response.</p>

<p>“The stake is well worth the risk,” Roberts
muttered. “I make the old Chink win.”</p>

<p>Kealoha came out with her guitar and in
the short twilight, she sang several plaintive Hawaiian
melodies. Then she suddenly arose and
went into the house.</p>

<p>Roberts got up from his chair and said, “Let’s
go out to Diamond Head. I have an idea that
the <i>Fanny</i> is somewhere around there.”</p>

<p>They went to the wharf and rousing the sailor
aboard the <i>Moi Wahine</i>, the sails were raised
and in the calm moonlight they sped away to
Diamond Head. When they were in full sight
of the light house, Roberts saw a green light
flash out over the water from a large black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
mass which was blacker than the darkness
around it. The green light was followed by two
red ones, and then by a white one. Roberts
returned the signal and sailed for the spot.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” he called softly.</p>

<p>“The <i>Fanny</i>” was the response. “Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Moi Wahine</i>. Don’t attempt to land at
Honolulu. Customs’ men are on to you. They
were looking for you yesterday.”</p>

<p>The <i>Fanny’s</i> captain laughed. “What would
you advise, Roberts?”</p>

<p>“Go to Pearl Harbor instead. Nobody has
seen you. The old fellow up there is asleep and
we can get up to Pearl Harbor with this wind
before daybreak. Once there, you can remain
in hiding ’til night. Then I’ll come and transfer
your cargo into the <i>Moi Wahine</i>.”</p>

<p>Capt. Mitchell favored the plan and with the
<i>Moi Wahine</i> in the lead, the two schooners
sailed to Pearl Harbor, where the <i>Fanny</i> was
anchored. The <i>Moi Wahine</i> was sailed back to
town and moored at her usual place.</p>

<p>“Nobody will be the wiser, old chap,” he said
to Ah Pung. “We’ll stay at home today and
tonight the opium will be brought back. Let
the stones stay in the hold until the next night,
then we’ll bring them to your house, a few at a
time. Then, Ah Pung, I’ll claim my reward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Ah Pung nodded and invited Sam in to spend
the day at his house.</p>

<p>After breakfast he followed Kealoha into the
yard, and watched her make a <i>lei</i>.</p>

<p>They were silent for a while when Kealoha
asked, “You’ll help my father land his opium?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p>“How much money will you get for the job?”</p>

<p>“No money at all; my dear, I get <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“You get me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your father has promised to let me
marry you if I succeed in landing the opium so
that the customs men won’t know.”</p>

<p>“Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“Dead easy.”</p>

<p>“But if I don’t want to marry you?”</p>

<p>“But you will,” he said smilingly.</p>

<p>“But I won’t,” she returned firmly. “Do you
think I sell myself or let my father sell me for
a load of opium. No, sir! What’s more, I am
to marry Kea.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very much.”</p>

<p>“Then do you want to see him go to jail?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I say the word, I’ll get him into
jail.”</p>

<p>Kealoha burst into tears. “You white men
are so cruel,” she sobbed out in Hawaiian. “Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
content with defrauding us out of our lands, you
wish to keep us from marrying one another.”</p>

<p>Roberts bit his lips. He disliked to see woman
in tears. He took her hands in his and said
gently, “Kealoha, listen to me.”</p>

<p>She raised her head and with brimming eyes
looked him full in the face.</p>

<p>“Kealoha,” he said, “couldn’t you learn to
love me?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Do you love Kea?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Then, Kealoha, I am not the man to cross
the love path of another man.” He was silent
for a moment then he continued: “I love you
as I have never loved before. You say you love
your father. For your sake, dear heart, I’ll not
betray him. Go, tell your father that I have
given my permission for you to marry Kea tonight.
Go.”</p>

<p>Kealoha threw her head upon his shoulder
and sobbed out her thanks. Then raising her
pretty face to his, she pressed a kiss on his lips
and left him to himself.</p>

<h3>A MODERN EVANGELINE</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-img unindent">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">he</span> sun was sinking behind the purple
hills in a little village in Madeira as a
tall, swarthy Portuguese hurried to his little
home.</p>

<p>“Ah, Manuel,” he cried as an older man came
out of a little side street, “have you heard the
latest bit of news?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="pt">Não</i>, Gabriel, what is it?”</p>

<p>“A man from the Sandwich Islands has come
here, offering to give us free passage to Honolulu
provided we work for three years on the
sugar plantations. He promises us twenty-two
dollars a month together with a house and free
water. I, for one, intend to go. Twenty-two
dollars a month! Why, fourteen is all I can
make here, working from early morning ’til late
at night. What say you; will you be one of the
company?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
“That I will. I have a brother there and my
wife has a sister. We shall tell the man that we
will go to his plantations, and then when we
get to the capital, I march up to my brother’s,
while the rest of you can go and till the soil. I
am a carpenter, and none of that dirty work
for me. A free trip! ha, ha, ha; I’ll beat the
American at his own game.”</p>

<p>“I do not consider that fair,” was Gabriel’s
response. “The American expects us to keep
our word. Furthermore, he is offering a reduced
passage rate to those who want to pay
their way.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do for me. Why, even at the
smallest possible rate, it would be an utter impossibility
for me to take one child, let alone
fourteen!”</p>

<p>Gabriel laughed. “Well, I am going to those
islands, but it is to work on a plantation. Three
years is but a short while, when you stop to
consider it, and by the end of that time, I will
have saved enough to get married on.”</p>

<p>“Do as you want to, boy, but I tell you
frankly that you are a fool. You are an excellent
mason; why throw away the gift which the
blessed virgin gave you, to kill yourself on an
old plantation for the sake of sentiment. It is
expected that there will be some that will take
advantage of this free trip idea, and you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
as well be one of those as not. But we’ll not
quarrel over the matter.”</p>

<p>They walked on in silence for some moments
until they came to a neatly white-washed cottage.
There were vines over the front and in
the little garden in the back, neat garlic patches
shared the space with cabbages.</p>

<p>“Will you come in?” Manuel asked.</p>

<p>“No, I have much to do yet tonight. The
ship leaves in two or three days and I must leave
my affairs in something like decency. <i lang="pt">Boa
noite.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="pt">Boa noite</i>, Gabriel, come over tomorrow and
let us make our plans.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and Gabriel continued on his
way, while Manuel turned into the cottage. He
was met at the door by his daughter, Maria da
Cruzs. He had eight daughters and all eight
were named Maria—of something or other. Of
course they all had middle names and occasionally
they were called by their middle names
to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>“Who was that you were just speaking to,”
she asked him.</p>

<p>“What! Did you fail to recognize the voice?
It was that of your own Gabriel.”</p>

<p>Maria da Cruzs blushed violently as she said,
“He is not my Gabriel.”</p>

<p>Her father laughed at his daughter’s discomfiture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and added teasingly, “He leaves for the
Sandwich Islands very soon.”</p>

<p>“For the Sandwich Islands? Why, they are
so many, many miles away. Has he enough
money to pay his passage?”</p>

<p>“No; an American has arrived offering us
free passage to Honolulu, provided we promise
to work on the sugar plantations for three
years.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father! Let us go.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was but yesterday that you said
nothing could induce you to leave Madeira.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said slowly, “but—”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t know then that Gabriel was
going away,” her father supplied. “Well, I
have almost decided to go myself, but not to
work on an old plantation, mind you. I am a
carpenter, and none of your dirty work on a
field for me.”</p>

<p>While they talked, Gabriel appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“I came back to tell you,” he said, after he
had greeted Maria, “that if you decide to go,
you must send in your names tomorrow. The
man has been here for some time but in this out
of the way place, news travels slowly, so that
I but heard it yesterday when I went to Senhor
Marques’ house to repair his wall, which fell in
the last wind storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
“Yes, I believe I shall send in my name tomorrow,”
said Manuel slowly, rising from his
comfortable position on the floor and going out
to the kitchen where his wife was preparing the
dinner for her hungry family, leaving Gabriel
and Maria da Cruzs together.</p>

<p>“Ah, Maria,” he said, “to think that we shall
soon be able to get married. In that blessed
paradise, I can surely make enough money to
support both of us. Then, too, our house will
be free of rent; and that is quite a saving.”</p>

<p>Maria was silent, but Gabriel could read in
her silence that she, too, was pleased with the
prospect which he was painting.</p>

<p>“Had we better get married before the boat
sails, or shall we wait until we get to Honolulu?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us wait until we get to the Islands,
and then we can tell better what lies before us.”</p>

<p>“Let it be as you say,” Gabriel responded, inwardly
well pleased that Maria was as enthusiastic
about the islands as he was.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” he said finally, “but I shall
see you again in the morning. <i lang="pt">Boa noite minha
querida</i>,” and he disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<h4><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></h4>

<p>The next morning, Manuel rose earlier than
his usual early hour, and waited for Gabriel.</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy,” he said walking toward the
road as Gabriel finally made an appearance, “if
you are as slow as that on the plantation, your
boss will hurry you up with his big black whip.”</p>

<p>“The bosses do not use whips any more,”
Gabriel responded.</p>

<p>“They do not? How do you know?”</p>

<p>“The American said so.”</p>

<p>“The American lies. I have a brother there
who went over with the first lot of Portuguese,
which left on the <i>Priscilla</i> nearly twenty-five
years ago, to Honolulu. The tales which he
used to tell me, when he came back, of how the
bosses, lunas, they call them there, used to treat
them, would simply scare you. No, sir, no plantations
for me, sir; and if you knew what I
know, you would say the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you know; how the lunas
used to take up the hoes which the men were
using, and bang them on the head with the
handles just because they felt like it. I know,
too, that they used to tie the men up to the fence
and whip them with their snake whips just because
the men were a trifle slow, and I know,
too, that things have changed within the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
years. With the coming of Annexation, the
plantation laborer does not suffer what he used
to, so to the plantations for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sure you have my permission,
but let us hurry; the sun is getting quite high
and we have a number of miles to go yet.”</p>

<p>They quickened their pace and were soon in
town where they found a crowd of men and
women gathered around a large building.</p>

<p>“That is where the American has his office,”
said Gabriel, “he is now receiving the names
of those who want to go. Come, let us enter.”</p>

<p>They walked in together and awaited their
turn to book.</p>

<p>“Your name,” asked the clerk finally of
Manuel.</p>

<p>“Manuel Gomes da Silva.”</p>

<p>“How many children have you?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="pt">Quartorze.</i>”</p>

<p>“How many is that?” asked the “Americano.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen! Good! That means fourteen
families some day to make their homes in Hawaii.
Fourteen different families to work on
the plantations. Good!”</p>

<p>Manuel did not understand what the American
was saying, but he made a very good guess
and smiled knowingly at Gabriel as he walked
up to the registrar.</p>

<p>“Married or single?” he was asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
“Single. I intend to marry Manuel’s eldest
daughter as soon as we get in Honolulu.”</p>

<p>His remark was translated to the American,
who rubbed his hands gleefully. “Better and
better,” he said. “There goes a man who will
make Hawaii his permanent home. In years
to come he will be able to vote and for all we
know, some of his children may serve in our
legislature.”</p>

<p>The interpreter laughed. The idea of a son
of a plantation hand being a Senator or even a
Representative appeared ludicrous to him, and
he said so.</p>

<p>“It has been done before,” he was told, “so
why can’t it be done again.”</p>

<p>“Done before?” asked the interpreter, “do
you mean to tell me that any of your public
men have had parents who worked on the plantations?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the response.</p>

<p>The interpreter shook his head. “It is unheard
of here.”</p>

<p>“Here, yes; but in America and in Hawaii,
no. Our school system accounts for that—but
here comes another man.”</p>

<p>All day the men booked, and when night
came, word was given to get ready immediately
as the boat sailed in three days.</p>

<p>Manuel and Gabriel stayed in town that night
and were taken to the wharf to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
<i>Suveric</i>, the boat which was to take them to
the Paradise of the Pacific.</p>

<p>The remaining days were ones of excitement
and bustle. For the two friends, however, there
was not much to do. No furniture was brought
as they could get furniture cheaply in Honolulu.</p>

<p>“I am going to look at the old house once
more before I go,” said Gabriel on the day the
ship was to leave.</p>

<p>“Better not,” advised Manuel; “you might
miss the boat.”</p>

<p>“There is no danger of that. The boat sails
at five this evening and it is now three in the
morning. All of my things are on board, so I
shall have nothing to do when I come back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go,” said <a id="chg1"></a>Maria; “the ship might
go earlier than they say, and what would I do
without you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” he said, “I want to put some
fresh flowers on my parents’ graves, before I
leave this island, never to return.”</p>

<p>She respected his sentiment and let him go
without a murmur, but not without misgivings
on both her and her father’s part.</p>

<p>“If he misses this boat, it will be a terrible
thing for him. All his clothes are aboard and
I have his money in my note,” Manuel said.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will have time to go and return,”
spoke up João Mello, who was Gabriel’s friend.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
“Gabriel is a fast walker and could go much
further than that in the same time.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” returned Maria, “suppose the
boat should leave earlier than we were told it
would?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that. If I had,” he
added thoughtfully, “I wouldn’t have let him
go. But let us hope for the best,” he added
cheerfully, seeing that Maria was about to cry.</p>

<h4><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h4>

<p>“Captain,” said the first mate of the
<i>Suveric</i> to his superior officer a few hours
later, “the tide is going out. Hadn’t we better
take advantage of it, and leave this morning
instead of tonight?”</p>

<p>“What do you say?” asked the captain of the
Americano.</p>

<p>“Well, the people are all here, so I don’t see
any objection to sailing now, if you want to.
I’ll pass along the word. Here, Francisco, tell
these people to get on board. We leave pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>“Pretty soon?” cried Maria as she heard the
order, “why, Gabriel will not be here until
night. Oh, why did I let him go!” And the
unhappy girl indulged her grief in shrieks of
the most heart-rending nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
“Oh, never mind,” said the <i lang="pt">Americano</i>, when
he heard the reason for her shrieks. “He can
come later. She will have learned some English
words by that time, and will have an advantage
over him in that she will be able to teach
him what she knows.”</p>

<p>But Maria was inconsolable. “I want my
Gabriel,” she moaned; “<i lang="pt">Ou meu Gabriel</i>.”</p>

<p>But crying and wishing for him did not bring
Gabriel to her, and the long, hard voyage to Honolulu
was endured without him.</p>

<p>True to the plans which he had made in
Madeira, Manuel did not go on a plantation,
but remained in the city, where he soon obtained
employment at a much better wage than he had
been accustomed.</p>

<p>Maria was fairly good looking, and the young
men of Honolulu were not slow in finding that
fact out, and many a suitor she had had before
she was in town many months. But she met
them all with the same answer, “I am waiting
for Gabriel.”</p>

<p>One day, news arrived that the <i>Kumeric</i>,
with another load of Portuguese, was coming,
and Maria was overjoyed.</p>

<p>“My Gabriel will surely come,” she told her
father.</p>

<p>“Your Gabriel?” he replied, “why, when
you were in Madeira, you said that he was <em>not</em>
your Gabriel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
“That was in Madeira,” she said.</p>

<p>While they talked on the subject one morning,
three loud blasts from a whistle interrupted
their conversation, and soon they heard that the
<i>Kumeric</i> had been sighted.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us hurry to the wharf,” Maria said.</p>

<p>“No hurry at all. It will take her two hours
to come in, so we will have plenty of time.”</p>

<p>But Maria was impatient and finally persuaded
her father to “go immediately.”</p>

<p>The wait was long, but finally the vessel was
tied to the wharf. No one was allowed aboard
her, and no one was allowed to leave her, so
those on the wharf had to content themselves
with picking out from the mass of humanity
huddled along the side of the ship, faces which
they recognized.</p>

<p>Maria peered anxiously at the people on
board, but she saw no Gabriel.</p>

<p>Disappointed, she was almost ready to give
up and go home, when her attention was attracted
by a tall man violently waving his cap
at her.</p>

<p>It was Gabriel, and with a cry of delight, she
rushed up closer to the side of the ship.</p>

<p>“<i lang="pt">Maria minha</i>,” Gabriel shouted.</p>

<p>“Good morning my dear,” she replied in
English.</p>

<h3>CUPID AND THE LAW</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-img unindent">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">here</span>  has been great rejoicing in the
little village of Hingyan, when Ito and
Hatsu were married. Ito had money, and he
spent it lavishly on his feast. No one could
honestly say that the host had been niggardly
with his sweetmeats or that there had not been
enough sake to go around. On the contrary,
the villagers declared that never before had they
attended such a sumptuous feast.</p>

<p>Ito was a rice planter. He owned the largest
rice plantation in the village and had the largest
stock of buffaloes in the entire district. But
one day he did not come to his noonday meal,
and when he arrived at evening he seemed very
much depressed in spirit.</p>

<p>“What is troubling my beloved one?” asked
his wife, who had never, since she had been
married, sat down to such a solemn meal.
Usually Ito was jovial and meal time was an
event to which Hatsu looked forward with
eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Ito tried to look pleasant as his wife spoke,
but failed, as he replied, “I fear that we are to
have a terrible drought this season. It has not
rained even in the mountains, and the water
supply is very, very low.”</p>

<p>“I will go to the temple tomorrow and offer
up a sacrifice to the Rain God. Perhaps he
will hear my prayers and send us an abundance
of rain.”</p>

<p>“I fear that he will not,” replied her husband;
“I have been daily to the temple this
week, and as yet there are no signs of rain.”</p>

<p>“Without rain the crops will fail?”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly. The rice is now in the
stage where it requires a large supply of water.
Unless we have rains this week or next week at
the latest, we shall have no rice until next
year;” and Ito sadly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Shall you lose so very much money if the
crops fail?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have been buying up all the available
lands owing to the fact that I needed more
to cultivate rice to supply the Maji contract.
Unless it rain, I shall become a poor man, as
there is a heavy bond connected with this contract.”</p>

<p>“A heavy bond?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If at the end of the season I fail to
produce the required number of bags, I shall be
obliged to forfeit more than two thousand yen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Besides, I mortgaged my lands when we got
married. Things look very dark for us. I
am afraid we shall be poor; very poor indeed.”</p>

<p>“I care not for the luxuries of life. The
necessities with my husband, are enough for
me.”</p>

<p>Ito kissed his wife fondly and was silent.</p>

<p>True to her promise, Hatsu went to the temple
and offered a bowl of rice to the Rain God.
Muttering a little prayer for rain, she left the
temple. “It will surely rain this week,” she
said; “the rice was of the best.”</p>

<p>But it did not rain that week, neither did
it in the next. And the rice crops became a
failure, and, true to his prophecy, Ito became
a poor man. The change of fortune left him a
small house and lot which had been formerly
used by his head planter. Ito barely eked out
a living by raising soy beans.</p>

<p>Finally, Ito called his wife and said, “We cannot
live in this miserable condition any longer. I
have decided to go to America and see what I can
do. They tell me that America is a land wherein
the poor man may become rich. Raising the
soy bean is not hard. I will leave you here to
tend to it. In three years or, maybe, two, I
shall send for you, and together we shall live
in what will resemble former days. If I fail,
I shall return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
In vain did Hatsu protest that she was just
as happy now in the days of want as she had
been in the days of plenty. Ito had decided to
go to America, and he went.</p>

<p>It was a sad leave-taking, but Ito cheered
his wife saying, “It is only for a few years. I
shall soon be able to send money for you to
come to me.”</p>

<p>Arriving in San Francisco, Ito found work
on a railroad, digging a tunnel which the company
had ordered made. He lived in a large
apartment house which the company furnished
its working men—all Japanese, who, like himself,
had come to the promised land to make
their fortunes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Accustomed to low wages in their own country,
they live accordingly. Coming to America,
with its higher wages, they keep their old
methods of living and save money. It was not
surprising, then, that at the end of two years
Ito had nearly a thousand dollars in the bank.
By careful investments at the end of the third
he was the owner of a sum which would accredit
him a rich man should he go back to
Japan. Should he go back to Japan, or should
he remain in America and have his wife come
to him? Letters had been but few between
them, as Hatsu could neither read nor write.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
When he “turned in” at night, the last question
which flashed through his brain was, “Shall I
go back to Japan?” and the first question which
greeted him on his awakening was, “Shall I
send for my wife?”</p>

<p>When he had decided finally to do the former,
go back to Japan, his foreman came to him
and said: “Ito, my boss section man sick; go
back to Japan. I give you the job; raise you
five dollars.”</p>

<p>After hearing this he resolved to stay, and
wrote a letter to his wife that night, telling her
to come to him. He would mail her a bank note
in the morning. Then they would be together,
and the old times and scenes would be reacted.</p>

<p>Bright and early did he rise the next morning,
for he had important work to do. As he
walked to the bank where he had his savings,
a countrywoman of his passed, and, bowing,
asked to be directed to a certain street. Ito
directed her. Long did he gaze after her, and
not until a policeman had told him to “move
on” did he leave the spot.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful woman,” he muttered. By
the way which the young woman arranged her
hair Ito knew that she was unmarried. A wild
thought flashed through his brain; why not try
to get this young woman for his wife? He had
forgotten the faithful and patient Hatsu, forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the little baby which he had never seen,
forgotten everything connected with his past
life, save that he had fallen in love with this
beauty. So the money remained in the bank,
and the letter was destroyed.</p>

<p>By degrees Ito became acquainted with the
beauty. Soon, from a mere acquaintance, a
warm friendship sprang up between the two,
and finally this friendship ripened into love,
and one day Ito announced to his comrades
that he was to be married. They congratulated
him warmly when they saw his wife, and
Ito thought himself a fortunate man.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“It is strange, my pet,” said Hatsu one morning,
“it is strange that your father has not written
to us. It has been nearly two years since
we last heard from him. He said that three
years at the most would be enough to earn
money to send for us. And now it is nearly
five. I wonder if—no, I will not think such a
thing of the most noble Ito.”</p>

<p>But she did think, and the more she thought
the more she became convinced.</p>

<p>At last she could bear the suspense no longer;
she would go to America and seek her husband.
So, selling the little house to enable her to get
passage money, all she brought from the old
home was Ito’s few but precious letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Eventually she, too, arrived at San Francisco,
but was refused admission.</p>

<p>“But my husband is here,” she told the interpreter.</p>

<p>“If that is the case,” the official replied,
“you may come in, but first you will have to
have your husband come to the station to prove
that you are his wife.”</p>

<p>By some mere chance Ito was passing the
Immigration Station. “There he is now,”
cried Hatsu, and she rushed forward to greet
her husband.</p>

<p>Ito was called inside and was asked, “Who is
this woman?”</p>

<p>Ito looked and saw Hatsu trembling with suppressed
emotion. Surely, oh surely, he would
say the word that would cease all troubles and
end all separation.</p>

<p>For an instant Ito paled. Like a flash there
came before him the view of a woman toiling
patiently among the soy vines, waiting daily for
a letter telling her to come to America.</p>

<p>He had been in the States long enough to
know that Uncle Sam laid a heavy hand on people
who had offended in the way that he had, so
he answered, “I do not know her.”</p>

<p>With a cry of anguish, Hatsu sprang forward.
“Ito,” she cried. But Ito was deaf.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that you do not know this
woman?” asked one of the officials. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
seen many shams, but this looked to him to be the
real thing.</p>

<p>“My wife live with me on Fillmore street,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said a bystander, “I sabe her. Her
number one pretty woman. Ito too much
lucky.”</p>

<p>Ito left the room, but the officials were far
from satisfied.</p>

<p>“I believe that he is this woman’s husband,”
said one of the commissioners who was present.</p>

<p>“So do I,” was the interpreter’s response.</p>

<p>“Tell her that I am taking a special interest
in her case. Ask her if she can prove that he
is her husband.”</p>

<p>Taking from her finger a small circlet of
gold, she said: “This ring was his great
grandmother’s. There is none like it anywhere.
When he sees it, watch his face. That
in itself will be sufficient proof.”</p>

<p>The interpreter took the ring, and the next
morning Ito received a warrant, ordering his
appearance in court immediately.</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney handed him a ring,
saying: “Have you ever seen anything like
this before?”</p>

<p>Ito took the ring and sank sobbing into a
chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
“I gave it to Hatsu the day we were married
in Japan,” he confessed. He was sentenced
on his own evidence and was led away to jail.</p>

<p>Poor Hatsu was broken-hearted. She dearly
loved Ito, and to think that he had played her
false was more than she could believe.</p>

<p>“Take me back to Dai Nippon,” she said;
“take me back. I go to die in the land of my
fathers.”</p>

<p class="drop-img unindent">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">he</span> town had been literally flooded that
year with quacks and fakers in the
shape of men who either claimed to be able to
cure disease in any form, or professed to have
some scheme by which men and women could
get rich in two weeks. It always happened,
however, that all those who fell victims to the
wiles of the last-named gentlemen, were poorer,
when the time expired, by a few, and sometimes
a good many, dollars.</p>

<p>Bollinger, however, eclipsed them all, both
in his remunerations and in his methods. He
came towards the close of the year, and when
he went away, he had enraged the people so,
that they shut the city’s gates to all magnetic
healers who tried in the future to locate in that
town.</p>

<p>Almost all of his class wore long, flowing
gowns and beards; but not so with Bollinger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
He wore a suit of the latest style and cut, and
was clean-shaven. Before he had been in the
town three days all the girls had fallen in love
with him. But Bollinger was an extremely
modest young man who had no intention of falling
in love with any of the enamored young
ladies—at least not during the first week.</p>

<p>Miss Camilla Knight was away when Bollinger
arrived in the town, and did not return
until he had been there nearly a week. It was
when she returned that Bollinger discovered
that being single had its disadvantages. He
made enquiries, and found out that Camilla lived
alone with her father, who, besides being a
widower, was a rough and austere man; one
who would brook no insult, intentional or otherwise,
and woe betide the man who dared to insult
Papa Knight by asking him for his daughter.
There were many young men in the town
who could show you the exact spot that they
landed upon after having been kicked off the
veranda of the Knight home, simply because
they had had the audacity to ask for Camilla’s
hand, and, incidentally, the rest of her.</p>

<p>Camilla had come home ill, and the doctors
had given up hope of saving her life. When
Bollinger heard this he hung up a sign which
read, “Doctor John Bollinger, Magnetic
Healer.” The town smiled. So this young
man who had been the cause of so much speculation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
as to what his business was, had proven to
be a mere magnetic healer. With one accord
they resolved not to patronize him. Camilla’s
father saw “Dr.” Bollinger’s advertisement in
one of the town papers, and also an editorial in
another, urging the people not to go to him.
He showed the paper to Camilla, who urged
her father to try him.</p>

<p>“He can’t do any harm, and he may do some
good,” soliloquized Papa Knight; “and I’ll be
hanged if I’ll not do anything because an old
editor tells me not to.” So he sent for Bollinger.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight was a little old-fashioned, and
his ideas of magnetic healers were somewhat
behind the time. It was no wonder, therefore,
that he was surprised when an up-to-date young
man handed him a card which read, “John Bollinger,
Magnetic Healer.”</p>

<p>“Be you the doctor?” he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I be,” the other replied, with assumed
gravity.</p>

<p>“Humph! You don’t look like you had
enough magnetic power to cure a fly.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless I have enough to heal your
daughter.”</p>

<p>“How did you know that it was my daughter
who was ill?” the astonished father asked.
“You have only just arrived, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I found out it was your daughter who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
ill, by my magnetic power,” Bollinger answered,
evading the last question.</p>

<p>“If that don’t beat all!” ejaculated the old
man.</p>

<p>“Allow me to see your daughter,” asked the
healer.</p>

<p>The old man led the way to Camilla’s room
and said to his daughter, “Here’s that young
healer you were so anxious to have come and
see you.” He asked her a few simple questions
as to where she felt the pain, and the like, and
was told that the pain was in her heart. Taking
a small pad from his pocket he turned to the
old man and said, “Do you read?”</p>

<p>“Printing, but not writing,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Does your daughter read?”</p>

<p>“Of course she does; do you think you are
the only one who has had an edication? Why
don’t you make use of your magnetic power and
quit asking so many questions?”</p>

<p>Bollinger did not answer <em>his</em> question, but
continued to write on the pad. Tearing off the
sheet, he handed it to Camilla and said, “Read
this to yourself twenty times an hour. But remember!
yourself. If you read it aloud, the
spell will be broken and I shall be unable to do
anything for you. I will come tomorrow and
see if you are any better. Good morning.”
And he picked up his hat and left the room.
Papa Knight followed him to the front door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and said, “How much do I owe you for today’s
work?”</p>

<p>“I prefer to collect my fee all at once,” the
doctor replied.</p>

<p>“How much will that be?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible for me to tell at present.
If the cure fails, I do not want a cent; if it
works—but we will talk of the pay later.”</p>

<p>“Queer fellow that,” said the old man to
himself as the healer left the house. “He’s
different from all the other magnetic healers
I’ve heard of before. Most of them want their
money before they begin to work, but this one
wants to cure before he gets his pay.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Camilla was reading her cure not
twenty times an hour, but sixty: “Dear Camilla,
I love you. Won’t you be mine? Answer
me when I come tomorrow,” she read, and
she did not wait to say “Yes” the first time to
Bollinger himself, but said “Yes” every time
she read it.</p>

<p>Dr. Bollinger went to visit his patient very
early the next morning to see how the “cure”
had worked. Papa Knight met him at the
door, his face all aglow with smiles. “By
George!” he said, “but you are a wonder. Why!
Camilla is as pert as a cricket this morning.
She wanted to get up and dress, but I wouldn’t
let her. I was afraid it might harm her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
“Why didn’t you? It would not have done
her any harm.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her now, if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I am anxious to complete
the cure. It is just begun. Let us go to Cam—to
Miss Knight.”</p>

<p>They went to the room and the first question
Bollinger asked was, “If anyone was to ask you
if the cure was a success, what would you say?”</p>

<p>“I would say, ‘Yes’,” she replied.</p>

<p>“And do you say ‘Yes’ to the question the
cure asked?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the response.</p>

<p>Bollinger must have forgotten where he was,
and who was present with him, for he lifted
Camilla from her bed, and kissed her again and
again.</p>

<p>“See here, young man,” said Papa Knight
when he had recovered from his astonishment.
“What in thunder do you mean?”</p>

<p>“This is a part of the cure,” Bollinger answered,
“and you must not interrupt.”</p>

<p>“Take those kinds of cures somewhere else,
you rascal; I don’t want any of them.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I want to give any of them to
you,” Bollinger answered.</p>

<p>“Git out of my house!” roared the old man.
“Git!”</p>

<p>“Before I go, allow me to tell you something
which will no doubt surprise you. I love your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
daughter; she, in turn, loves me. Have we your
permission to get married?”</p>

<p>Force of habit is strong, and, for answer,
Papa Knight opened the door leading to the
veranda, and prepared to treat Bollinger as he
had treated many others who had asked him a
similar question. But Bollinger was too quick
for him. He caught the old man up as if he
were a child, and placed him upon a chair.</p>

<p>“I’m determined to have your daughter, Mr.
Knight, cost what it may. Will you give her to
me, or shall I have to take recourse to my magnetic
power to get what I want?”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go with this young upstart,
Camilla?” her father asked.</p>

<p>“He is not an upstart,” she said, stoutly.</p>

<p>“Don’t contradict! Answer my question:
Do you want to go with this young fellow?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then go; I wash my hands clean of you.
Git!” he shouted.</p>

<p>And they “got.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Bollinger,” said a young man to the magnetic
healer-of-a-day as they were seated in the
former’s comfortable rooms in a hotel, “I heard
today that you at one time practiced magnetic
healing. Is that true?”</p>

<p>Bollinger glanced at his wife and both broke
out into peals of laughter. When they finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
calmed down, Bollinger asked, “And did your
informer tell you who my first patient was?”</p>

<p>“Your wife,” was the laconic answer. Mr.
and Mrs. Bollinger laughed again.</p>

<p>“I think you might tell me what the joke is,”
the young man said.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Bollinger, “I was spending
my vacation in Logansport one summer, where
I met Mrs. Bollinger. She had come to see an
aunt who lived near my hotel, and we saw a
good deal of each other. By dint of many enquiries,
I found out that her father was a tough
customer, so I laid my plans accordingly. You
see, I had fallen in love with the fair Camilla,
and I could not rest until she was mine. Upon
reaching home, Miss Knight was to pretend
that she was ill. I was to bribe the old country
doctor to declare that Camilla was beyond all
hope of recovery. Then I was to step in, and,
with my magnetic power, cure her, and, out of
sheer gratitude, Papa Knight would give her to
me. But when I did cure his daughter’s
malady, like old Pharaoh, he hardened his
heart, and instead of giving me his daughter
he wanted to give me a kick. I threatened him
with my magnetic power, and he finally gave
her to me. There’s the story of the time when
I practiced magnetic healing. Are you satisfied?”
and, looking at Mrs. Bollinger, he burst
into another roar of laughter, but this time his
guest joined him, for he was thinking that the
little ruse would bear repeating.</p>

<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_b.jpg" alt="B" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">y</span> Jove, I’ve an idea!” Doctor Rothwell
brought down his tilted chair
with a resounding whack.</p>

<p>“An idea?” said Rodger Wilbur, throwing
down the paper which he was reading, “really,
let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“I was reading an account in a paper Frank
sent me from Honolulu of a battle which took
place there a number of years ago. They celebrated
the anniversary or did something the
other day worthy of the account occupying preferred
position on the front page.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s so interesting in that? Lots
of celebrations here in New York have the report
of their doings on the front page.”</p>

<p>“The account went on to say,” continued
Rothwell, ignoring his friend’s remark, “of how
a large number of men were sent to their death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
by some chief driving them over a huge precipice.
That was a pretty long time ago; now
the plain is covered with the skeletons of the
warriors and it is visited by the Hawaiians occasionally,
who have a secret trail to the place.”</p>

<p>Rothwell paused for breath and Wilbur languidly
remarked, “Anything more connected
with this idea of yours?”</p>

<p>“Rodger Wilbur, you are a man who does not
deserve the luck which Dame Fortune is laying
at your door. You don’t deserve to hear anything
about a plan that will pull more in a day
than your measly law gives you in a month.”</p>

<p>“Come Rothwell, don’t get angry. Explain
yourself a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, my plan is this; let us go to Honolulu,
get the teeth in that valley, bring them
back to New York, and sell them as artificial
teeth. We’ll open up a wholesale “false tooth”
shop and, my boy, our fortunes are made. The
expense will be practically nothing as we were
both planning to spend the summer in London.
The cost of living there would be more than we
would spend in Honolulu. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go; and I say old chap, just sort of
forgive me for showing a lack of interest in
your plan at the beginning, will you?”</p>

<p>“I will this time, but I don’t promise to
always. This is not the only occasion in which
you have showed a lack of appreciation for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
schemes of my fertile brain. But when shall
we start?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The trip was uneventful and when the <i>Priscilla</i>
landed at Honolulu, she had on board two
very impatient passengers in the shape of
Dr. Rothwell and Rodger Wilbur. That very
day they hired a hack and rode out to the <i>pali</i>,
where they saw for themselves the plain of
which they had read.</p>

<p>“Any way to get down there?” Rothwell
asked to the driver, on their way homeward.</p>

<p>“Sure; want to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Alright, I’ll find you a man that will take
you there. I’ll come to your hotel, say at nine,
and he’ll be waiting up there for us.”</p>

<p>The enterprising tourists were ready promptly
the next morning and were taken in tow by
the Hawaiian guide. They noted the landmarks
carefully for their plans were to make
many visits to this El Dorado.</p>

<p>As he started to turn back for home, Rothwell
slipped on a skull which was hidden in
the grass and by some freak of pressure, the
strong man’s leg snapped like a pipe stem.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty how-do-you-do,” said Wilbur,
“how on earth are we to get you home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
“No <i>pilikia</i>,” said the guide, “my house
near. I take care of him till him get better.
My <i>kekei wahine</i> she <i>akamai</i> fix sick people.
One week—<i>pau</i>! No <i>pilikia</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only thing we can do I guess,”
said Wilbur. “If his daughter is anywhere as
pretty as that flower girl we saw yesterday on
the wharf, you have no kick coming. Besides
I’ll be here every day gathering those teeth.
Say, did you notice what a lot of them there
are here?”</p>

<p>“More than even I dared hope. Our fortunes
are made.”</p>

<p>Between them, the Hawaiian and Wilbur
managed to carry Rothwell so that the motion
caused but little pain to the wounded leg, and
they soon arrived at the grass hut in which the
guide and his daughter lived.</p>

<p>The father spoke a few words to his daughter
who came out to greet them, and she turned into
the hut. They followed her and found her
busy preparing a bed of fresh grass over which
she had laid a sheet of <i>tapa</i>. They place Rothwell
on his new bed and Violetta deftly treated
the wounded member.</p>

<p>“I think better we go now,” said the Hawaiian
to Wilbur, “unless you like <i>moi moi</i> in
my house.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, but I’ve an engagement for tonight
or I would. Good night, Rothwell. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
seeing your pretty nurse, I almost wish that it
was my leg and not yours that is out of commission.”</p>

<p>The sudden pain which darted through Rothwell’s
leg caused him to smile grimly at his
friend’s wish, but he bade him good night without
another word.</p>

<p>When Wilbur went to see him the next morning
Rothwell said, “Wilbur, you’d better quit
coming here until I get better.”</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p>“Because people might want to see me and
might be tempted to stroll toward yonder plain.
I never credited myself with possessing the only
enterprising brain in the world, and some of our
Honolulu friends might think of the scheme
themselves if they saw those teeth lying around.
So you had better visit somebody in town for a
while.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say. But how are these Hawaiians
treating you?”</p>

<p>“As if I were Kamehameha himself.”</p>

<p>“Grub good?”</p>

<p>“A sick man is not particular and seldom
wants much grub. They’ve got a sticky substance
they call <i>poi</i>, which they use in place of
bread that’s great. Try some,” and Rothwell
pushed over toward Wilbur a highly polished
calabash containing a greyish substance.</p>

<p>“Got a spoon handy?” that worthy asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
“Spoon? you’re a green one for sure. <i>Poi</i>,
my dear sir, is eaten this way,” and Rothwell
stuck two fingers into the calabash, gave a quick
twist and placed what adhered to them into his
mouth and made a grimace of delight.
“<i>Ono</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed! Thank you; nothing of
that sort for me,” and nothing could induce
Wilbur to taste poi.</p>

<p>He soon left, and Violetta, who had seen Wilbur’s
expression of disgust while Rothwell was
initiating him into the mysteries of poi-eating,
laughed softly. “Your friend is very particular,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Very.”</p>

<p>“Why did you come to Hawaii?”</p>

<p>“Well,—er—for business.”</p>

<p>“You want to buy a sugar plantation?”</p>

<p>“No, I am a dentist and my friend is a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“What is a dentist?”</p>

<p>“A man who tends to your teeth.”</p>

<p>“There are plenty of teeth out on the plain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what my friend and I are here
for; to take those teeth back to New York where
we came from, and sell them to the other
dentists.”</p>

<p>“You must not take those teeth away.” The
black eyes flashed. “That plain is sacred; you
must not touch anything there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
“But think of the money there is in this
proposition.”</p>

<p>“The teeth must always remain here,” she
said firmly as she left the room.</p>

<p>“Here’s a rum go,” said Rothwell. “I hadn’t
figured on the Hawaiians caring.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said on the subject until
Rothwell was able to walk about. Wilbur came
up to see him and plans were made to carry off
as large an amount of teeth as was possible.</p>

<p>“Say, Wilbur, these Hawaiians object to us
taking the teeth.”</p>

<p>“They do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and quite strenuously. However,
we’ll take our chances.” They left the hut and
started in the direction of the plain.</p>

<p>The old Hawaiian saw them and knew what
they were after. His daughter had told him of
the plans and, like her, he objected to having
them put to the use which the two strangers
planned.</p>

<p>“They shall not do it!” he exclaimed, “they
shall not take away the teeth of those brave
men.” He followed Rothwell and Wilbur and
appeared among them as they were filling their
bags with teeth.</p>

<p>“Up higher,” he said, pointing to a smaller
precipice, “was where the men of Maui fell.
They were noted for their beautiful teeth. My
daughter tells me that the haoles are making a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
collection of teeth. They must not fail to secure
at least a few of these to take back home.”</p>

<p>Unsuspecting in the slightest the two men
followed. They climbed the high precipice,
their guide in advance. Wilbur followed with
Rothwell close after them. As they neared the
top the guide held on to a little bush which
grew near by and suddenly kicked backwards.
The force of the blow was sufficient to throw
Wilbur off his balance, and he fell against Rothwell.
Clutching vainly in the air, both men
went tumbling down the precipice, and fell on
the plain beneath, mangled beyond recognition.</p>

<p>The old Hawaiian gazed in silence at what
had been two men, then he muttered softly,
“The valley is safe.” He slowly climbed down
the height and went back to his hut. Violetta
met him at the door, a look of enquiry on her
face.</p>

<p>The guide said nothing for a moment, then
he repeated, “The valley is safe.”</p>

<h3>THE RAID AT PUNCHBOWL</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-img unindent">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">here</span> were ten grocery stores within a
radius of half a mile from where
Manuel Jacinto lived, and all catered to the
Portuguese trade. Not enough people lived
around there to keep more than two grocery
stores in comfortable circumstances, yet the
owners of the eight others managed to pay their
bills, their yearly license fees, and to put money
in the bank.</p>

<p>And Manuel Jacinto was thinking of adding
another store to the long string. Others made
money so why couldn’t he? The same way
by which the others managed to subsist would
put him on the road to being a rich man provided
he was careful and escaped being <i>apanhado</i>,
as the term was for those upon whom the
heavy hand of the law descended.</p>

<p>He was telling his friend José all this one
bright Sunday morning as they quietly sipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
their Madeira which Manuel had brought from
the old country with him on the <i>Suveric</i> when
he, and over a thousand of his compatriots, decided
to cast their lot in the Paradise of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>“But why do you have to fear the law?” José
asked, “What law can you be breaking by keeping
a grocery store?”</p>

<p>Manuel laughed. “When you have been here
as long as I have,” he said, “you’ll understand
that the laws here are a bit different from those
in old Villa Nova. How do you suppose that
ten grocery stores exist in such close proximity?
Hardly any of them sell enough groceries
to pay the rent. ’Tis the little back room,
my friend, the little back room which makes us
want to start more stores.”</p>

<p>“The little back room? What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>José was a recent arrival and had as yet not
become acquainted with the ins and outs of a
Portuguese grocery store.</p>

<p>“All these stores have a little back room
where men may come together for a good time,”
replied Manuel with the superiority born of a
year’s stay in Honolulu. “The store keepers
want to make money (and who does not?) so
they put in a barrel of wine in one corner of
this little back room, and a table in another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
They propose that a game be played and that
the loser treat the crowd to wine. With a
chance to get a number of glasses of <i>vinho</i> for
nothing the men begin to play and the store
keepers make money, for some one always loses.
And there is money in this business for me.
The other stores add a little water to their wine
to increase the profits. I shall sell only pure
wine. You know that I brought a large number
of casks of the best with me when I came.
My place will be eagerly sought after and, provided
the law does not interfere, I shall be
rich.”</p>

<p>José nodded in acquiescence. There was
much to learn that was different in Honolulu.</p>

<p>Shortly after his talk with José, Manuel
opened up a store and as a special inducement,
he offered a glass of three-year-old Madeira to
all visitors on his opening day. It was not
long before card games were in progress at
Manuel’s and the attendance daily increased.
His wine was purer, it was older, and it was
stronger than the kind the other stores supplied.
The players got drunk faster at Manuel’s than
they did elsewhere, and more than one fight was
fought in that little back room. Finally a man
was seriously injured in one of these fights and
then the police began to sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>“We’ll raid that place tomorrow night,” said
the Sheriff to a friend who brought him news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of the latest escapade for which the wine in
Manuel’s place was responsible.</p>

<p>“By the way,” asked the friend, “how do you
raid?”</p>

<p>“Easy. We send in a man with a marked
coin to purchase a drink. We usually have him
buy a bottle of wine which he brings out to us.
Then we go in and arrest the store keeper. We
nab the cash drawer, get the marked coin and
bring it to court with the bottle for testimony.
It’s easy to convict in this way.”</p>

<p>João Pinto, known to the rest of the force as
“Long John,” overheard this conversation.
Long John was in love with Maria, and Maria
was Manuel’s daughter. Supposing that her
father should send Maria to sell the wine on
the morrow? He loved her, but his duty would
compel him to arrest her just the same. If he
did though, he would have to give up all hope of
marrying her. If Maria was not selling wine
at the time of the raid, her father would, and
that was almost the same, for Maria fairly worshiped
her father, and, were he arrested, she
would never forgive the <i lang="pt">policia</i> who had a hand
in the affair. Ah! he had a plan. He would drop
a note to Maria hinting at the proposed raid on
the morrow. He would plead sick the next day
and so escape being sent out. John chuckled at
the plan. Writing the note he dispatched it by a
small boy who lived near Manuel’s store. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
went back to the office and met the chief, who
said: “John, that new store on Punchbowl is
raising hell with the Portuguese. We’ll raid
that place tonight.”</p>

<p>“Tonight?” burst involuntarily from John’s
lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, tonight. Things are worse than I
thought. We can’t put it off for another day.
Here’s the marked coin. Go in and have a
game of cards; lose; treat the crowd. We’ll
be there about seven. So long.” And the chief
went out to dinner.</p>

<p>Tonight! and he had told Manuel in his letter
to have a good time that evening as on the
morrow the store would have to be quiet.</p>

<p>But it would soon be seven and his duty had
to be performed even at the cost of Maria.</p>

<p>He entered the store and was greeted heartily
by Manuel who took him aside and whispered,
“Thanks for the warning. I’ll give my consent
for any day which you may choose to
marry Maria.”</p>

<p>John nodded mechanically as he turned to go
to the card table. “Let’s have a game of cards,”
he said. “The loser pays, of course.”</p>

<p>All turned their attention to the game. The
well thumbed pack was brought out and given
to John to cut. The game progressed merrily
enough for the others, but John was silent.
Finally he lost the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
“Wine all around,” he muttered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Here, Maria,” shouted her father to the
daughter in the store proper, “come and give
these gentlemen some wine.” They drank the
wine and John flung the marked coin on the
counter and started for the door.</p>

<p>Oh, this raiding business was awful!</p>

<p>But before he had reached the door he heard
Manuel shout to his daughter, “<i lang="pt">Ajoga o dinheiro.</i>”
(Throw away the money.) “The police
are upon us!”</p>

<p>Maria had the coin, which John had paid, in
her hand. Just outside the little back room
was a pit covered with boards over which her
father’s horse and wagon were washed. Maria
ran out quickly, dropped the coin between the
cracks, and heard the splash which it made as it
touched the water.</p>

<p>She returned and saw an officer examining
the cash drawer for the marked coin.</p>

<p>“<i lang="pt">Eu digo a verdade</i>,” her father said, “Me
no sell wine; me give mans.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar,” said the officer testily, for he
hated to be beaten in a raid, “but just the same
I’ll have to let you go this time. Look out for
us, however.” And the police left the store
amid the jeers and gibes of the hangers-on at
Manuel’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
“The rascal,” said Manuel to his daughter
when all was quiet, “to try and catch us in a
trap like that.”</p>

<p>“Never mind him,” said Maria with a toss
of her pretty head. “I fooled him once tonight
and I’ll fool him again. I just promised
Antonio that I’d marry him after the <i lang="pt">Festa do
Espirito Santo</i>.”</p>

<span class="smcap">f</span> course it happened at the club. Things
of this kind always happen at a club,
either because the members feel freer to discuss
the weaker sex when they are not around, or
because some men think a club the only place
for such speeches.</p>

<p>John Harris made the remark, and Walter
Andrews, the pet of half the ladies in the town,
was its bitterest opposer.</p>

<p>“I do not believe it,” he said vehemently.
“You can not make me believe it.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, my boy, I repeat; no one ever
saw or heard of a really beautiful woman who
was good. Mark you, I’m not saying anything
against the merely ‘very pretty girl.’ I’ll admit
that there are some very pretty women who, in
addition to their loveliness, are really good.
But these are merely pretty, not beautiful,”
Harris replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
“What is your standard of ‘goodness’ in a
woman, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll admit that my ideal woman would
be hard to find. Even the ‘goodness’ part would
be largely above par in a plain, ugly woman,
let alone in a beautiful one. So I’ll take off a
few requirements, and if you can find me a
woman who is not a flirt even in the strictest
sense of the word, and who never has been
accused of trying to make a man love her, and,
when she has him in that fix, declare that she
only ‘likes him,’ and ‘hopes that they’ll always
be friends’; if you can find such a woman, I’ll—but
you can’t.”</p>

<p>The subject was dropped, and shortly after
Andrews left the club. He went home early and
to bed, but sleep did not come as it was wont to.
All night long he tossed thinking of what Harris
had said, and wondering where he could find a
woman who could come up to the requirements.</p>

<p>It was a very preoccupied Andrews which entered
the office of “Roberts and Andrews” the
next morning, and more than once his partner
asked, “What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” was the invariable response.</p>

<p>Toward afternoon, Mr. Roberts came to him
and said, “Andrews, my niece is coming here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
to visit us for a while. Can you suggest anything
which would be nice for a young lady of
twenty or twenty-one to do?”</p>

<p>“How’s yachting?”</p>

<p>“The very thing. Funny that we did not think
about that. Diana is very fond of it, she writes.
You have a yacht, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What do you call her?”</p>

<p>“The yacht’s name is <i>Diana</i>,” said Andrews,
digging his paper-cutter into the blotter on his
desk.</p>

<p>“Queer name that, for a yacht. If I wasn’t
positive that I had not mentioned my niece’s
name to you, I would swear that you christened
your boat since I began talking to you. However,
I will have to go back to the house for a
while, as I left Diana’s picture at home and
Jones wants to make a cut of it for tomorrow’s
<i>Leader</i>. I’ll be back soon and will show it to
you before I take it down.”</p>

<p>The senior partner left the office and Andrews
laughed loud and long. “Positive that he
hadn’t mentioned the young lady’s name to me,
was he? Oh, that reminds me that I’ll have to
get the name on the yacht changed.” He reached
for the ’phone and after getting into communication
with the man that took care of the boat for
him, he said, “Say, strike off the name and put
on <i>Diana</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Andrews had barely resumed work when
Harris came in. “Hello, old man,” he said in
response to Andrews’ greeting, “I dreamed
about you last night.”</p>

<p>“The dickens you did,” replied Andrews, “I
dreamed about <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“This is getting interesting. What did you
dream?”</p>

<p>“I dreamed that I saw the most beautiful
woman imaginable coming toward me with outstretched
arms. Just as I was about to touch
her she disappeared, and in her stead, I saw
you. You had a hard, cynical sneer upon your
face and you said to me, ‘She is beautiful, but is
she good?’ Yes, she is beautiful, but she is not
good.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Andrews, my dream was almost
exactly like yours. What can it mean?”</p>

<p>Walter shook his head. “I don’t know,” he
said; “but I wish you hadn’t made such a fool
statement.”</p>

<p>Roberts came in just then, and excusing himself,
Harris left the office.</p>

<p>Walter went over to the old man’s desk and
watched him as he slowly took out a large photograph
from a mailing envelope. Andrews gave
one glance at it, then with a shriek he flung
the picture to the floor and sank into a chair pale
as a sheet. Mr. Roberts looked at him in blank
amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“I am not feeling well,” he explained as he
picked up his hat to go home.</p>

<p>The picture which his partner had shown him
was a duplicate of the face he had seen in his
dreams, and which, without doubt, was the same
which his friend had seen.</p>


<h4><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h4>

<p>The train to Mulford slowed down at the
station of the little seaport town and from one of
the parlor cars a young woman stepped out to
the platform.</p>

<p>“She was beautiful.” There was no denying
the fact. Even the most unemotional man
would have stared long and hard at the retreating
figure once he caught sight of her face.</p>

<p>Anthony Roberts stepped out from the interior
of the station and kissed his niece impulsively.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Now then, Harris,” said a voice at his ear,
“dare you say that that beautiful woman is not
good?”</p>

<p>Harris turned and saw a young member of
the club who had been present when his challenge
had been made. “Hello, George, what
woman do you mean?”</p>

<p>“The one walking with old man Roberts.”</p>

<p>Harris looked in the direction which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
friend pointed, then gripped his arm convulsively.</p>

<p>“What the mischief are you gripping me that
way for? If all women affect you this way no
wonder you say that no beautiful woman is
good. But, man, you are pale as a ghost. Are
you ill?”</p>

<p>“I am not well. Let’s go to the club.”</p>

<p>When they reached their destination, Harris
sought a secluded corner. “Has she come to follow
me up and torment me again?” he thought.
“Poor Walter, if he sees her he’ll try to prove
that although she is beautiful, this—” he swallowed
hard—“is a good woman. By God! I’ll
let him alone, let him get severely punished and
see if he won’t change his mind a bit. They
said that I was to marry her.” Silently one
by one there came to him scenes of what had
seemed like a year in heaven, and following
them, came what he had thought a miniature
Hell on earth.</p>

<p>As if from the throat of some unseen person
there came the word, “I can’t marry you John,
let us just be friends.”</p>

<p>“I hate you,” he shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>A waiter ran up to the room. “Did you call,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, bring me a whiskey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Tossing the glass off at one gulp, Harris left
the room.</p>


<h4><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></h4>

<p>As Walter was about to open the door to his
private office the sound of girlish laughter
floated over the open transom.</p>

<p>“It must be Diana,” he said. Opening the
door he stepped into his office.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Andrews,” said his partner,
“allow me.” He took Andrews’ arm and led
him up to the sofa where the young lady of his
dreams was seated.</p>

<p>Andrews bowed his acknowledgment of the
introduction. He could not trust himself to
speak. The room was swimming about him and
he seemed to be enveloped in a hazy mist, out of
which a woman’s voice was saying, “I made
bold, Mr. Andrews, to come in and arrange
your office; freshen it up a bit, you understand.”</p>

<p>Andrews pulled himself together and looked
about him. The usual staid office was transformed
into a flower garden. Flowers were
banked upon each other in a way which bespoke
a practised hand.</p>

<p>Roberts and his niece left Andrews’ office and
went to the firm’s waiting rooms.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with your partner?”
Diana asked, “he has such a far away look in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
his eyes and he seems to be miles away from the
office.”</p>

<p>“Only lately, my dear, only lately. I believe
you have had some thing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“I, Uncle?” Diana gasped in astonishment,
“what do you mean? I never saw him before.”</p>

<p>“Until I showed him your photograph, Andrews
was all that one could ask, but when he
saw your picture, he dropped it as suddenly as
if he were holding a hot coal, gave a shriek, and
skipped out of the office. I had intended to ask
him what made him act the way he did, but it
passed my mind.”</p>

<p>“I am going to ask him myself.” And Diana
started for Andrew’s office.</p>

<p>“Diana,” called her uncle. But that young
lady kept on until she had reached Andrews’
room. She knocked twice and receiving no answer,
opened the door and walked in. She
found Andrews with his head down upon his
arms on his desk. Gently touching him on the
shoulder she said, “Mr. Andrews!”</p>

<p>Walter started up suddenly. “I beg pardon,”
he stammered, “but I did not sleep at all well
last night and now I was almost gone. Can I,
and may I, be of any assistance to you?” His
old manner had returned and he was now the
Walter Andrews which his partner had known
all his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Diana was astonished at the sudden transition
which had taken place and it was her turn to be
at a loss for something to say.</p>

<p>“Uncle said you had a yacht,” she finally began.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “will you be ready to go
out with me this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I should be delighted to go.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, then Diana
said, “Mr. Andrews, I heard that when you saw
my picture you dropped it and gave a scream
of terror. May I ask why?”</p>

<p>Andrews dropped back into the manner which
Diana had first seen him. In a strained tone
of voice he said, “Miss Langdon, someday, but
not now, I hope to be able to tell you the reason
for my astonishing behavior.”</p>

<p>“‘Some day, but not now,’” she quoted;
“When will that be?”</p>

<p>“When I have known you better,” he said
bluntly. “When may I call for you?”</p>

<p>“I have changed my mind; I am not going.”</p>

<p>“But you promised,” reminded Andrews.</p>

<p>“I do not care if I did,” she returned with
some heat as she rose and left the room.</p>

<p>“‘She is beautiful, but is she good?’” Andrews
unconsciously murmured. “Oh, confound
it, will I never forget that dream?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<h4><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></h4>

<p>Towards afternoon Andrews heard a gentle
knock on his door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said.</p>

<p>Miss Langdon entered dressed in a sailor
suit. “You see,” she explained, “I just realized
that a promise is a promise and so I’ve come to
go yachting with you. Can you go now?”</p>

<p>“Can I go?” asked Andrews. “Just watch
me.” And giving his desk cover a pull, he
reached for his hat and said, “I’m ready now.”</p>

<p>“It took you less time to get ready than it
took me,” she smiled.</p>

<p>Andrews looked admiringly at her costume
but said nothing. The distance to the pier was
not long, and today Andrews found it much
shorter than usual. Given, a bright vivacious
girl and a man who appreciates that kind, and
it needs no mathematician to prove that they
will make a congenial couple.</p>

<p>The day was delightful. Just the right
amount of wind was blowing for a sail. They
talked pleasantly for some time as the big yacht
skimmed over the water like a great white bird.
Then Andrews said, “Miss Langdon, I have a
friend who says that all women are flirts. Is he
right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
“Really Mr. Andrews, you take me at a disadvantage.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Why, you ask me either to laud or condemn
myself, and you know that no man can, on trial,
be compelled to give testimony against himself.”</p>

<p>Andrews laughed. “Let’s change the subject.
See that school of red fish?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we were in Hawaii and these fish
came into the harbor we might expect to hear
of the death of a member of the royal family.
The Hawaiians have a superstition that these
fish come to announce the death of a chief. Are
you at all superstitious?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe that thirteen is an unlucky
number.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“There were thirteen of us in our club and
all but five got married before the club was a
year old.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a club; Browning or Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>“Neither. We had vowed solemn vows that
we would not marry until—” she stopped short.</p>

<p>“Why do you stop?” Andrews asked.</p>

<p>“You men say that women can not keep a
secret. I guess that you are right. I came near
giving our club secret away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
They soon landed, and giving Diana in charge
of her uncle, who was at the dock waiting for
them, Andrews went to the club.</p>

<p>“Diana,” said her uncle, “what made you go
with Andrews after you said that you would
not?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said that young lady, “because I
love—sailing.”</p>


<h4><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></h4>

<p>Andrews met Diana quite frequently during
the following days. Their meeting always
awoke in Andrews the question, “Will she stand
the test?”</p>

<p>“I can stand this no longer,” he said one day;
“I shall have to settle the matter at once.” He
turned to his telephone and calling up Miss
Langdon, asked her if she cared for a sail.</p>

<p>“I’ll be down directly,” she replied, and she
soon appeared. They boarded the yacht in
silence. Neither spoke for a while, then Andrews
broke the silence saying, bluntly, “Diana,
I love you; I have always loved you. Will you
be my wife?”</p>

<p>Miss Langdon was silent for a moment, then
she asked, “Why did you act the way you did
when you saw my picture?”</p>

<p>“Your answer first,” groaned Andrews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
“I cannot give you my answer today. Come
to my uncle’s tomorrow and I will answer then
and there. Let’s go back.”</p>

<p>Knowing that it would be useless to argue
with her and make her give him her answer immediately,
Andrews turned the yacht and
started for home.</p>

<p>After landing, he took her to her uncle’s and
left her at the gate. She had not asked him
to come in, but he had not noticed the omission.</p>

<p>“One who has never been accused of trying to
make a man love her, and when she has him in
that fix, declare that she only likes him and
hopes that they will always be friends,” kept
ringing in his ears. Certain it was that since
she had met him Diana had tried to make him
love her. Would she stand the test?</p>


<h4><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></h4>

<p>Andrews did not come to work the day after.
“He ’phoned me that he would not be down
until afternoon,” said Roberts, when Harris
called to see his friend. “He is not feeling well.
But, Harris, you have not met my niece. Come
this way.” An urgent message intercepted him
as they went to Andrews’ room, and hearing
that his niece and Harris were old acquaintances,
Harris was left to renew his friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Somehow, Harris had not met the young lady
since her arrival at Mulford. He avoided all
parties and gatherings which he knew she was
to attend and once he had gone away just as he
reached the door of a friend’s house, because he
caught a glimpse of her as she talked to Walter
Andrews.</p>

<p>Harris stopped at the door. Should he go in
or should he meet her and denounce her and her
works? He decided on the latter and knocked
at the office. A low voice bade him enter. Closing
the door he turned and saw the beautiful
woman reading a book. Looking her full in the
face he said, “Diana.”</p>

<p>“John!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is John. Diana, have you changed
your mind?” Somehow the dreadful words
which he had planned to utter failed to come
and instead he realized that he loved her, and
loved with his whole heart.</p>

<p>Diana was silent. “Then you still do not love
me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I really do not know,” she replied softly.</p>

<p>Harris started for the door.</p>

<p>“John,” she called.</p>

<p>He left the door and flung himself beside her
chair.</p>

<p>“I love you,” she said; “I love, love you.”</p>

<p>It was the same old story, the telling of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
has never made it grow out of fashion. He
caught her up and kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>“Won’t Andrews be glad that I am at last
to settle down and marry the most beautiful
woman on earth?” he asked playfully.</p>

<p>“I think not,” she answered.</p>

<p>“You think not? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because yesterday he asked me to marry
him.”</p>

<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>

<p>“To call this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Send for him now; don’t keep the poor fellow
in suspense.”</p>

<p>A messager was dispatched and Andrews
came looking haggard and wan.</p>

<p>“Your answer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Andrews, I sent for you to tell you
that I can not marry you. I love another man.
Can’t we just be friends?”</p>

<p>Andrews sank into a chair. “He was right,”
Andrews muttered, “Harris was right. No
beautiful woman is good.” Then springing up
he shouted, “‘Let’s be friends,’ did you say?
Never! Henceforth my greatest enemy shall be
a beautiful woman.”</p>

<h3>A FATAL EXCURSION</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-img unindent">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="75" height="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">hree</span> is a large school in Honolulu,
called the Royal School. It is so named
because at one time only children of royal blood
were allowed to attend it. But that is another
story.</p>

<p>Business with the principal took me up there
one day, and, while waiting for him, I sat and
talked with the janitor.</p>

<p>The school is on a small hill and the road
near it is quite steep. Trolley cars run up that
road and come down with the speed of lightning.</p>

<p>“Whew!” I could not help exclaiming as one
car in particular shot past us, “if some day an
axle should break, more than one person would
get hurt, and badly too.”</p>

<p>“You bet,” replied the janitor. There was a
pause, and then he said, “Anyhow, I never ride
in them cars unless I can’t help it. I hate anything
with wheels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
I smiled, sympathetically, I thought, but I
suppose in his estimation it was a smile of incredulity
for he hastened to say, “I used to be
a locomotive fireman, but since the day that Jim
got killed, I’ve had but little use for anything
but my legs.”</p>

<p>Scenting a story, I asked, “How was that?”</p>

<p>He bit off a fresh bite of tobacco and then
began:</p>

<p>“As I said before, I used to be a locomotive
fireman over on Hawaii. Good job alright, but
I couldn’t stand it after Jim died. Jim was my
friend, and a right good fellow he was. His
job was night watchman on the docks, but his
health gave way and the doctor told him the best
thing he could do was to go to ’Frisco.</p>

<p>“My run included Kohala—ever been there?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t know what you have missed
then. The scenery is magnificent. I had often
talked with Jim concerning the place, and he
was just crazy to go and see for himself. He
never had a chance, though, because he used to
sleep all day and work all night. But when
the doctor ordered him to throw up his job, he
came to me and asked me to try and get him a
permit to ride on my train. We were on a
freighter, and didn’t carry passengers, so I went
up to the manager, and told him the circumstances.
But the manager was cross that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
and of course he said ‘no’; said he’d quit giving
passes to people. I told that to Jim and he was
dreadfully disappointed; told me he wanted to
see the place before he went back to the States.
So I went to my engineer and asked him to
take Jim as a brakeman. At first he refused,
but I insisted, and while we were talking, a
kanaka woman came up and said that her Joe
wouldn’t be able to work that trip, as he was
sick.</p>

<p>“I jumped up and made the engineer promise
to take Jim in his stead. He said ‘yes,’ and I
went to tell Jim that he might go, and to explain
his duties to him. We were to leave at
six o’clock Sunday morning, and I left Jim’s
house early so as to let him sleep enough to get
up early the next morning.</p>

<p>“Sunday morning came, and, by Jove! I
never saw a more beautiful morning again. The
birds were singing most glorious, and the sun
shining through the heavy dew drops, made
them look like so many diamonds.</p>

<p>“Before you get to Kohala, you have to come
to a steep, curved incline. We always whistled
for ‘brakes’ when we got there and I had explained
to Jim that when we’d blow three
whistles, he was to apply the brakes. He said
he understood and took his seat on a brake, one
of them circular kind that you turn with your
hand, you know. He sat on the last box car,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
but there were a whole lot of flat cars back of
him.</p>

<p>“We started off; Jim enjoying the air, and I,
happy in thinking that I had been able to give
the poor fellow such pleasure. By and by we
came near that curve and the engineer blew the
whistle for brakes. Before we started, Jim
seemed to understand the signals, but now the
cars were coming down that hill faster than I
had ever seen them before.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter with that brakeman?’
the engineer asked me.</p>

<p>“‘I dunno,’ I said, ‘unless he’s fallen off.’</p>

<p>“‘Maybe that’s it,’ the engineer told me,
‘when we get to the bottom of this, we’d better
see.’ So when we got to the foot of the hill, he
stopped the engine and we walked back.</p>

<p>“It was at the beginning of the curve that we
found Jim. Yes, he had fallen off. Poor fellow;
ten flat cars had gone over him, and there
was mighty little left of him. He had been
cutting up some tobacco for his pipe, and we
found his pipe and a plug of tobacco and his
knife lying near him. I’ve got the knife at
home now.</p>

<p>“When we got back from Kohala, I packed up
and came to Honolulu. I couldn’t stand any
more railroading.</p>

<p>“That’s why, I can’t bear cars of any sort.
Do you blame me?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t say that I did.</p>
